This branch is from a project pursued by my classmates and I. I have branched to rename files in order to make navigation easier.

main-notebook: This is the ipynb which contains the data analysis using python.

CSS_final_report: This is an informal write-up of our analysis which should not be referenced to outside this readme

two CSVs: these are the datasets that are pre-loaded for the notebook
